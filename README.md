## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### 🔍 Testing Approach
- **Unit Testing**: 
  - Focused on individual method validation
  - Used JUnit for business logic verification

- **Integration Testing**:
  - Tested service implementation interactions
  - Verified component integration

- **Mocking**:
  - Utilized Mockito to isolate dependencies
  - Simulated external service behaviors

### 🛠 Tools Used
- JUnit
- Mockito
- Spring Boot Test Framework

### 📊 Key Metrics
- **Code Coverage**: Over 85%
- **Defect Rate**: Zero critical defects
- **Test Cases**: 100+ unit and integration tests
